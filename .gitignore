# This .gitignore file is configured to exclude specific files and directories 
# commonly generated by macOS, development tools, programming languages, 
# and frameworks. Below is a breakdown of the excluded items:

# macOS: Excludes system-generated files such as .DS_Store and Apple-specific metadata files.

# Logs: Prevents log files (e.g., logs.txt and *.log) from being tracked.

# Kubernetes config: Excludes Kubernetes configuration files like kubeconfig.

# Python: Ignores Python cache files (__pycache__) and compiled Python files (*.py[cod], *.pyo, *.pyd).

# C#: Excludes compiled binaries (*.exe, *.dll), debug files (*.pdb), and Visual Studio-specific files (*.cache, *.mdb, *.user, *.suo, *.sln.docstates).

# VS Code: Prevents the .vscode directory, which contains editor-specific settings, from being tracked.

# General: Ignores temporary files such as swap files (*.swp) and backup files (*~).

# Secrets: Excludes sensitive files like Secret.yaml to prevent accidental exposure of credentials or sensitive data.
